    <head> <font size=50pt">Welcome to my website!</font></head>
    <br>
    <p>This website is all about the <b>animals</b> I love. I'm a huge fan of <em>cats</em>, <em>dogs</em>, and <em>minibeasts</em>.</div><br>
    I invite all the animals into my home on Christmas eve. Here's my <b>favourite</b> picture of us all:</p>
